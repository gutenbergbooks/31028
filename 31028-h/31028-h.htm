<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>Bohemia has decided to have a
Coalition Government. Several London
morning papers are prepared to
offer them one in good going condition,
providing they pay cost of transit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to a contemporary, "rabbits
are worth less when they are skinned by
the shopkeeper." So is the customer.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"It is of greater advantage to know
the Welsh language," says Professor
<span class="sc">Trow</span>, "than to know French." That
is, of course, if you wish to use it for
defensive purposes.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Gordon Hewart</span> has declined to
"make any attempt to consider what
is to happen after the next election."
The fact of the matter is that <i>The Daily
Mail</i> itself has not yet decided.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is reported that an opposition
League of Nations is to be started
among countries addicted to war. The
League will take cognisance of all outbreaks
of peace.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A peculiar incident is reported from
a large town in the South of England.
It appears that one day last week a
bricklayer lost count of the number of
bricks he had laid, with the result that
a recount had to be made to enable him
to ascertain whether he had finished
for the day or not.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Post Office Workers' Union Conference
at Morecambe declared last
week that the Government was "without
capacity, courage or principle."
Apart from these defects they have no
fault to find with it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Jagadiz Chunder Bose</span>, lecturing
at Westminster School, said that
plants, like human beings, are sensitive
to pain. Some of the war-time allotment
marrows we heard so much of
must have suffered badly from obesity.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Most actors, in the opinion of an
official of the Actors' Association, are
better off than they used to be. But
what we want to see is an improvement
when they are on.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>American shipping circles deny the
rumour that they are building a liner
measuring thirteen hundred feet in
length. We felt at the time that this
vessel must have been a Canarder.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Although a heavy safe was bodily removed
from a small house in Wolverhampton
during the night, not one of
the four persons sleeping in the next
room was awakened by the burglars.
Such thoughtfulness on the part of the
intruders deserves the greatest credit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"A single greenfly," declared a speaker
at a meeting of the R.S.P.C.A., "may
have fifteen thousand descendants in a
week." This almost equals the record
of the Chicago millionaire who recently
died intestate.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A motor-cyclist who was thrown from
his machine as a result of colliding with
a car near Birmingham was asked by
the occupants of the latter why he did
not look where he was going. This in
our opinion is a most difficult thing to
do, as one's destination is so uncertain
until the actual landing takes place.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On being sentenced to six months'
imprisonment at a London Police Court
last week a burglar threw his boot at the
magistrate and used insulting language
towards him. We understand that in
future only law-abiding criminals will
be allowed inside the court.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A Hackney boy has dug up a Queen
Anne shilling. We understand that, on
hearing the price of sugar, the shilling
asked to be put back again.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The old gentleman who, after reading
in the daily papers that all hairy caterpillars
should be destroyed at sight on
account of their destructive powers, tried
to crush a Society lady's pet Pekinese
in Hyde Park with his foot is now supposed
to be short-sighted.</p>

<p>Then I reflect: "'Tis not so strange;</p>

<p>His heart to Sinn Fein's gospel wed,</p>

<h2>THE BEST PICTURE IN THE ACADEMY.</h2>

<p>Let me see. I must have been battling my way through
the Galleries step by step for an hour and three-quarters,
and I haven't yet decided which is the best picture.</p>

<p>But then it's no easy matter to make up one's mind when
there are so many, many pictures&mdash;and so many, many
people....</p>

<p>And some of them, I'm sorry to say, are not quite so
considerate as they might be. For instance, I had nearly
chosen Mr. <span class="sc">Clausen's</span> <i>Shepherd Boy: Sunrise</i>. I was
imagining the hush, the solitude. Suddenly two inexorable
hats were thrust between me and the canvas, while two inexorable
voices carried on a detailed discussion about what
Doris (whoever Doris may be) was wearing at the wedding
yesterday.</p>

<p>It wasn't fair to me; and it wasn't fair to the <i>Shepherd
Boy</i>. I know he hasn't got a face, poor fellow. But is
that a reason for putting ideas into his head?</p>

<p>It seems to me the crush is fiercer than ever in front
of the picture over there. Probably I shall find that to be
the best of all; <i>No. 274</i>: Mr. <span class="sc">J. J. Shannon's</span> <i>Sir Oswald
Stoll</i>. Ah, I see. These ladies are simply using the unfortunate
gentleman as a looking-glass to tidy their hair in.</p>

<p>But oh, Sir <span class="sc">Oswald</span>, do I really look as tired as all that?
Yes, you're right; I <i>am</i> tired. I'll go and sit down.</p>

<p>Not a vacant seat anywhere.... Yes, there is&mdash;quick!
At the far end of the Galleries. Now isn't it just like the
<i>Supreme War Council</i> to have left that one chair empty for
me at their table?</p>

<p>No, it's a trick! The artist knew I should never have
the effrontery to sit there, right under the <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span>
nose. Very well, Mr. <span class="sc">Olivier</span>, exhausted though I am, I shall
not vote for you either.</p>

<p>There's a dull pain all down my spine. My feet are like
lead. Give it up? Never! I will not leave until I have
found the masterpiece.</p>

<p>But I can stem the tide no longer. I surrender myself
to the mob and let it bear me whither it wills....</p>

<p>Where am I? Oh, the Architectural Room. Thronged this
afternoon, like all the others. And yet, once upon a time, before
I grew old and weary&mdash;heavens, how weary!&mdash;I remember
this room with only one other person in it, and she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Why, here! Right in front of me; <i>No. 1235: London
County Westminster and Parr's Bank, Ltd.: Brondesbury
branch</i>. That's it. That's the best picture in the Academy!</p>

<p>Not so much because of its chiaroscuro, not because
of its romantic associations, but because, immediately opposite
that branch-bank, there's a place where at last, at
long, long last&mdash;ah!&mdash;I can sit down.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<h2>OPEN DIPLOMACY.</h2>

<p>Stung to the quick by the accusation of secrecy hurled
at him by a portion of the Press in connection with the
conference at Lympne, Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> has arranged
with M. <span class="sc">Millerand</span>, we understand, to make the next
encounter, on French soil, a vastly different affair. As a
delicate compliment to the Welsh blood shared by the
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> and the greatest of our Tudor kings, and
through the courtesy of Sir <span class="sc">Philip Sassoon</span> who has
kindly promised to defray the whole of the expenses, the
<i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> will be arranged to resemble, almost to the
minutest detail, the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</p>

<hr  />

<p>The place of meeting will be between Ardres and Guisnes.
Hundreds of skilful workmen, if they do not happen to be
on strike, will be employed in erecting the pavilions that
are to lodge the two statesmen, who will meet in open
field, but not be allowed, either of them, to visit the camp
of the other lest they be suspected of secret diplomacy.
M. <span class="sc">Millerand</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> will first meet riding
on horseback, and each wearing as much cloth of gold
and silver as can possibly be put upon their backs. Mimic
jousts and mock combats will be held. Lord <span class="sc">Derby</span>, Lord
<span class="sc">Riddell</span> and Mr. <span class="sc">Philip Kerr</span> will all encounter chosen
French champions. Six days will be given to tilting with
the lance, two to fights with the broadsword on horseback,
two to fighting on foot at the barriers. Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
will wrestle with M. <span class="sc">Millerand</span>.</p>

<hr  />

<p>On the last day there will be a gorgeous masque, at which
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> will appear accoutred as Hercules, wearing
a shirt of silver damask, with a garland of green damask
cut into vine and hawthorn leaves on his head, and in his
hand a club with fourteen spikes. His Nemean lion skin
will be of cloth of gold, and his buskins of the same material.
Fountains of French wine will play in the British marquee.
M. <span class="sc">Millerand's</span> chief pavilion will have a magnificent dome,
sustained by one huge mast, covered with cloth of gold and
lined with blue velvet, with all the orbs of heaven worked
on it in gold, and on the top outside a hollow golden figure
of St. Michael. All the Press, but particularly those representing
Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe's</span> papers, will be not only
allowed, but entreated and cajoled, to go everywhere and see
everything, to play about with the ropes of the tents and
take snippets of cloth of gold for souvenirs.</p>

<hr  />

<p>Oh, how different from Lympne (pronounced "mph")!</p>

<h3>HAMPSTEAD.</h3>

<p>The trouble about Hampstead is that
it is so very much further from Kensington
than Kensington is from it.
Every day, I believe, there pass between
Kensington and Hampstead telephone
conversations something like
this:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Kensington.</i> When are you coming
to see us?</p>

<p><i>Hampstead.</i> Why don't <i>you</i> come
<i>here</i> instead?</p>

<p><i>Ken.</i> It's such a fearfully long way.</p>

<p><i>Hamp.</i> I like that. Do you know
that a bus runs the whole way from
here to Kensington?</p>

<p><i>Ken.</i> I don't blame it. But I'm jolly
sure it doesn't go back again.</p>

<p>Then Hampstead rings off in a rage
and nothing is done about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Rudyard Kipling</span> must surely
have known of this regrettable estrangement
or he would never have sung&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"North is North and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,</p>
<p>Except in the Tube at Leicester Square or the corner of Oxford Street."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Anyhow you will find that people
living in Hampstead tend more and
more to regard themselves as dwellers
in the mountains, and take defiantly to
wearing plaid shawls and big hobnail
brogues, and carry alpenstocks in the
Underground with them. They acquire,
moreover, the keen steady gaze of those
who live in constant communion with
the silent hills, so different from the
Oriental fatalism in the eyes of the
Kensingtonite, which comes from the
eternal contemplation of the posters of
<i>Chu Chin Chow</i>.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to visit Hampstead,
if you are sufficiently venturous,
by bus, tube, tram or train. If you are
very rich the best way is to take a taxi-cab
as far as Chalk Farm, where London's
milk supply is manufactured. You
cannot go further than Chalk Farm by
taxi-cab, because the driver will explain
that he is afraid of turning giddy, having
no head for heights. You have then
the choice of two courses, either to purchase
the cab outright and drive it yourself,
or to finish your journey by the
funicular railway.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that you have done
the latter and emerged on the final peak
which surmounts the Hampstead range.
On your way upwards you will have
been charmed by the number of picturesque
houses which seem to have
been thrown at the side of the hill and
to have stuck there, and also by the
luxuriant groves of cocoanut palms and
orange and banana trees which the
L.C.C. has thoughtfully planted to provide
sustenance for London on its Whitsuntide
Bank Holiday. It is indeed a
pleasant thought that so many hard-working
people are able on this day to
snatch a little leisure in the good old
English fashion on the swings and
roundabouts and forsake the weary
routine of watching American films.
These great crowds picnic also on the
greensward, bringing their food in
paper wrappers, so that a student of
such matters can easily gauge the proportionate
circulation of our principal
morning dailies by taking a walk
round Hampstead Heath early on Whit-Tuesday
morning.</p>

<p>When you have reached the last summit
you will find yourself confronted
by a frowning Gothic pile known as
Jack Straw's Castle, and a large flagstaff
on which the flag is only flown
when the castellan is in residence.
There is also a pond where the inhabitants
of Hampstead, both old and young,
swim their dogs after sticks and float a
great variety of boats. On fine mornings
there is such a confusion of boats
and sticks and barking dogs that, if you
are lucky, you can come up with an
Irish terrier and an ash plant and go
down rather proudly with a Newfoundland
and the latest model of <i>Shamrock
XIV</i>.</p>

<p>Looking downwards from the top
you will discern on the open slopes and
twinkling amongst the vegetation a
vast multitude of white poles. On
Saturday afternoons, I believe, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405" id="page405"></a>[pg 405]</span>
are more poles on Hampstead Heath
than in the whole of Kieff. Each pole
is attached to a boy scout, and it has
been calculated that, if all the boy
scouts in Hampstead were to set their
poles end to end in a perfectly straight
line from the flagstaff, pointing in a
south-easterly direction, they would be
properly told off by their scout-masters
for behaving in such an idiotic manner.</p>

<p>Next perhaps in interest to the boy
scouts, both because of their quaint
medi&aelig;val costume and the long lances
which they carry in their hands, are
the rangers of Hampstead Heath.
Feudal retainers of the L.C.C., they
sally ever and anon from their lairs
with lances couched to spear up the
pieces of paper which the people of
London have left behind; and this
paper-sticking is really the best sport
to be enjoyed now on Hampstead Heath,
unless one counts fishing for dace in
the ponds, which I take to be the most
contemplative recreation, except coal-mining,
in the British Isles.</p>

<p>Amongst the very many famous
people who either live or have lived at
Hampstead may be mentioned Mr.
<span class="sc">Gerald du Maurier, Constable</span>, Lord
<span class="sc">Byron</span>, Lord <span class="sc">Leverhulme, John Masefield,
Joe Beckett</span>, the younger <span class="sc">Pitt</span>,
Miss <span class="sc">Marie Lloyd, Keats</span>, Madame
<span class="sc">Pavlova, Romney, Claude Duval</span> and
<span class="sc">Richard Turpin</span>, the last of whom, I
believe, bequeathed his spurs to the
borough in grateful memory of all that
it had done for him. There are no highwaymen
to be met at Hampstead Heath
now, but the solicitor and house-agent
of the man from whom I am trying to
lease Number&mdash;&mdash;but there, perhaps
I had better not go into that just now.
I cannot however omit to say a few
more words about <span class="sc">Keats</span>, because the
nation is trying to buy his house,
although it has not yet been decided
which of them is to live in it if they get
it. In the garden of this house the poet
is said to have written his celebrated
"Ode to a Nightingale," and the nightingale
may still be heard on Hampstead
Heath in June. Presumably it is
the same bird, and the lines,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird;</p>
<p>No hungry generations tread thee down,"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>must be taken as a remarkable instance
of literary foresight, for crowds of people
have for years been trying in vain to
trample the brave bird down and have
evidently been hungry, or they would
never have left so much sandwich-paper
about.</p>

<p>Oh, and there is yet one more notable
resident of Hampstead, as you have
doubtless just gathered, and that is
myself, or will be if those accurs&eacute;d&mdash;&mdash;but
another time, perhaps.</p>

<h3>THE TARTAR PRINCESS.</h3>

<p>She was staying at a Finnish hydro
near Helsingfors. I asked for her on
the telephone and her old mother answered.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Monsieur Anatole? Fancy
ringing up so early&mdash;twelve o'clock!
Of course Tatiana is in bed. One can
see you have been away from your
native country a long time. We left
Petersburg three months ago. Come
and see us at a reasonable time&mdash;say
three o'clock&mdash;and we'll tell you all
about it."</p>

<p>My two years' sojourn in England
had accustomed me to English ways.
I had certainly committed an indiscretion
in ringing up my former clients (I
was their legal adviser in Petersburg)
at such an unconscionable time.</p>

<p>I found Tatiana, in a smart black
glac&eacute; gown, reclining on a sofa and
smoking a cigarette in a dull sitting-room,
surrounded by other Russian
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i>. She jumped up when she saw
me.</p>

<p>"At last, Monsieur Anatole," she
said. "You remember when you left
Petersburg in 1918 I told you that you
would be submarined, but here you are
back again safely. I'm <i>so glad</i>." Her
eyes shone and she held out her little
white hand. "You have brought it
with you?"</p>

<p>"What with me?"</p>

<p>"The soap, of course. Surely you
remember. I asked you to buy me
some Savon Id&eacute;al in Paris. It is the
only kind that suits my skin."</p>

<p>"But I haven't been to Paris."</p>

<p>"You haven't brought my soap!
Why haven't you been to Paris?"</p>

<p>"I have been to London."</p>

<p>She pouted. "Why stay in London
instead of Paris? What silliness!"</p>

<p>"And how did you get here?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"By sledge. It was terribly exciting
and illegal, of course, and dangerous.
Petersburg's awful. All the pipes have
burst and there are no Russians there."</p>

<p>"No Russians!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Because the best people&mdash;I mean,
of course, the people who won't work&mdash;have
all adopted other nationalities.
We are&mdash;what are we, Mother?"</p>

<p>"I think it's Adgans, my dear," the
old lady chimed in.</p>

<p>"Adgans," I repeated.</p>

<p>"Something of that sort," said the
Princess. "It doesn't matter about the
name, but it's more convenient. You
are under the protection of your Government
and then your property benefits."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Azerbaijans?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay."</p>

<p>"But what claim have you to become
Azerbaijans?"</p>

<p>"Every claim," she answered with
asperity. "Somebody had a property
there once&mdash;either one of our family
or a friend. Why don't your family
become Esthonians? You'd find it
much more convenient. Your father
could leave Petersburg."</p>

<p>"But he's never been to Esthonia."</p>

<p>"That's nonsense," said Tatiana;
"he must have travelled through Reval
at some time, and besides I remember
he went to Riga once to fight a case
for the Government."</p>

<p>"But Riga's in Latvia," I protested.</p>

<p>"What does that matter? Anyhow
we escaped with two hundred thousand
roubles and one small trunk. The first
few weeks we had a great time here
and spent all our money, but after that
we had to 'put our teeth on the shelf.'"</p>

<p>"But how did you manage without
money?"</p>

<p>"Well, we sell our things&mdash;jewellery
and clothes. I think you might at least
have come back through Paris; I can't
understand how you forgot about the
soap. You've no idea what bad manicurists
the Finns are; they've torn my
fingernails to bits."</p>

<p>"But when you've sold all your
clothes and jewellery what do you intend
to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>Tatiana laughed. "Then there's
the house in Petersburg that will fetch
quite a lot of money, and there are a
number of people here who want it."</p>

<p>"How can you sell a house to people
who can't get to it?" I asked.</p>

<p>Tatiana shrugged her shoulders. "Of
course I can sell it all the better because
they don't know the state it's in. I
think England must have made you
rather silly. You wrote and asked me
to lunch without my husband and you
know it's not done in Petersburg;
you've become quite English."</p>

<p>"But last time we met you were just
divorcing the Count and I wasn't quite
sure of your relations with your new
husband."</p>

<p>Tatiana kissed the tips of her fingers.
"He's lovely!" she cried enthusiastically.
"A real Cossack officer. Why,
there he is! Dmitr&eacute;, this is Monsieur
Anatole, our family lawyer. He'll sell
the house for us, and he's promised
me some Savon Id&eacute;al from Paris.
You'll go to Paris, won't you?" she
said, putting a very seductive face close
to mine.</p>

<p>I parried. "It's difficult for Russians&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right; you can become
a Czecho-Slovak. I can give you a
letter; you need only stay there half-an-hour
when you're passing through."</p>

<p>I felt my cherished Russian nationality
slipping away and my only safety
seemed to lie in an instant departure.
I caught her hand and kissed her polished
finger-tips. She bent forward and
kissed my forehead.</p>

<p>"Good journey," she said.</p>

<p>"A happy time at home," I answered,
and, saluting her husband, I hurried
to the door.</p>

<p>"I'm glad there's a little bit of
Russian left in you," she called after
me. "And by the way you might
bring two boxes of the soap; it doesn't
last long."</p>

<h3>MUCH THE BETTER HALF.</h3>

<p>"Then you mean that neither of you is coming to the
concert?" said Margery.</p>

<p>"Speaking for myself," said John, "the answer is in
the affirmative&mdash;or negative, just as you prefer. Any way,
I'm not coming. Your worthy brother must decide for
himself."</p>

<p>"Our worthy brother-in-law has spoken for me, Margery,"
I said; "I also regret my inability to assist at the revels."</p>

<p>"Then all I can say is I think you're a couple of pigs."</p>

<p>"Margery, Margery," said John, "really your language&mdash;&mdash;I
shall have to write to the papers about you."</p>

<p>"That's the idea," I joined in. "'The Modern Flapper,'
by 'Broad-minded but Shocked.' You'd better look out,
Margery, or you'll never marry. The papers are full of
letters about people like you. There's a beauty this
morning. Half a minute; I'll read it to you."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself, please," said Margery, curling
her lip up somewhere
over her right eyebrow.</p>

<p>"No trouble at all,
it's a pleasure," I said,
turning over the pages.
"Ah! here we are. This
is signed 'Disgusted
Ex-Soldier.' Listen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'<span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Speaking as
one but recently returned

<p>"That's you he
means," said John.</p>

<p>"Pah!" said Margery.</p>

<p>"And bah! to you
twice," said John.</p>

<p>"Shush, both of you,"
I said; "listen to 'Disgusted

<p>"'What was it kept up our hearts and spirits during the
terrible days and nights in the trenches?'"</p>

<p>"The Rum Ration," cried John. "Hear, hear. Loud
cries of 'Down with Pussyfoot!'"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort," I said. "'It was the thought of
the sweet simple girls at home in England that nerved us
during those frightful days.'"</p>

<p>"Was it? So it was. Of course," said John feebly,
"I forgot."</p>

<p>"'It was for them that we suffered as we did.'"</p>

<p>"Did we? I mean was it? So it was," said John,
growing enthusiastic. "Good old 'Ex-Soldier!' What's
he say next?"</p>

<p>"'And when we return at last from the toil and stress
of war [Grunts of appreciation from John], what do we
find?'"</p>

<p>"Pork and beans," said John.</p>

<p>I looked at him severely.</p>

<p>"John," I said, "this is no matter for idle jesting.
Listen what the poor fellow goes on to say, "'What do
we find?'"</p>

<p>"Boiled be&mdash;&mdash;I don't know, Alan," he finished hurriedly
as I looked at him again. "I&mdash;I don't think I
found anything."</p>

<p>"'We find,'" I continued, treating him with contumely,
"'a laughing, giggling, smoking, jazzing, frivolous and
slangy crowd of ill-mannered flappers, devoid of all interest
in the higher aspects of life and thinking only of the latest
fox-trot. What hope have I of finding among such as
these the woman who will look after my home and bring
up my children?'"</p>

<p>"Hooray!" said John, "that's the stuff to gie 'em."</p>

<p>Margery squeaked with indignation.</p>

<p>"Look after his home, indeed," she choked. "The
impertinence of it! The conceited ape! Who does he
think he is?"</p>

<p>"Margery," said John in his special deep tone, "you are
too young to understand these things."</p>

<p>"Understand them! I should just think I am. I didn't
believe such conceit existed in a man nowadays."</p>

<p>"It isn't conceit, my dear Margery; it is the Right
Attitude to Adopt," said John, speaking in capitals. "Personally,
I admire the man. Begin as you mean to go on,
I say."</p>

<p>Margery snorted.</p>

<p>"I should just like
to see you beginning
then," she said.</p>

<p>"That is precisely
what I am going to do,"
said John, leaning back
in his chair and stretching
his legs. "I see
now that I have always
been too easy-going
with Cecilia. From now
onwards, however, there
will be a difference. I
shall be master in my
own house. In short&mdash;er&mdash;<i>nous
avons
chang&eacute; tout cela!</i> Am
I right, Alan?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to speak
of," I said; "but the
idea's good. Carry on,
John."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, the idea's
the thing, as <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> said. Anyway, the point is that
'Ex-Soldier' has awakened my sense of manhood. In
future I shall, as I say, take my rightful position."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said Margery; "and how are you going to set
about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, here's a case to begin with," said John. "I
have said that I won't be dragged round to your beastly
village revels to-morrow, and I stick to it. What Alan does
is his own concern. For my part I shall spend to-morrow
evening having a quiet million up on the table."</p>

<p>"I'm with you," I said; "we will bash the globules
together."</p>

<p>Margery decided to change her tone.</p>

<p>"Don't be beastly, John," she said; "you know Cecilia
expects you to come with us."</p>

<p>John laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Precisely, my dear Margery," he said, "and that's a
very good reason why I shouldn't go. Cecilia always
does expect me to do everything she wants. And I'm
so good-natured I have always given way. But never
again, Margery; I shall <i>not</i> come to the concert. I shall
say to Cecilia, 'Cecilia, I am not coming to your concert,'
and that will end the matter."</p>

<p>"Then I think you're a selfish beast," said Margery.</p>

<p>Just then Cecilia came into the room.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>[pg 409]</span>

<p>"And who's a selfish beast?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Not me, Cecilia," I said. Cecilia is my elder sister,
and I have known her for many years.</p>

<p>"It's John," said Margery. "He's talking the most
awful rot, and now he says he won't come to the concert."</p>

<p>"Won't come to the concert?" said Cecilia, lifting her
eyebrows. "Of course he's coming. Alan's going to sing
and John will probably have to say something."</p>

<p>I sat up straight and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"No, Cecilia," I gasped, "I really can't sing. I'll turn
up if you like and cheer and all that sort of thing, but
really I can't sing."</p>

<p>"Of course you can. You must. I've told them to put
your name down. Everybody has got to do something.
It's for St. Dunstan's, you know, and everyone for miles
round is turning up."</p>

<p>I subsided, murmuring feebly.</p>

<p>John was gazing moodily at the fire.</p>

<p>"So that's that," said Cecilia cheerfully, resting her hand
softly on his shoulder. "And <i>you</i>'d better be thinking what
to say to make the jolly old farmers stump up, my dear."</p>

<p>John cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;er&mdash;decided not to come to the concert, dear,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, John," said Cecilia, cooing like a
covey (or whatever it is) of doves. "Of course you're
coming. I've arranged it all."</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather stop at home, dear," he said; "I
can&mdash;er&mdash;look after Christopher and&mdash;er&mdash;there's a bit of
work I have to finish."</p>

<p>"Christopher will be in bed, and your old work can wait,

<h3>MEETING THE COUNTESS.</h3>

<p>"Could you find time to meet the
Countess of Aire?" inquired the Vicar's
wife with her gracious smile, after we
had chanced together at a corner of our
village street. "At five o'clock," she
added, "at the cross-roads."</p>

<p>"I shall be charmed," said I. "But
what a funny meeting-place."</p>

<p>"It seems to me very natural," said
the Vicar's wife.</p>

<p>"Is there going to be speech-making?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"How absurd!" she answered. "But
of course there will be a discussion."</p>

<p>"Who else will be present?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No one," she said.</p>

<p>I was never so puzzled in my life.</p>

<p>"It really seems rather odd," said I,
"that we should meet alone at the
cross-roads. And it seems so romantic
too. At five o'clock, you said? I always
think that is such a sentimental hour."</p>

<p>A bewildered look now crept into the
Vicar's wife's face.</p>

<p>"Are you joking or serious?" she
said. "Perhaps I have not made myself
clear. I am simply asking if you
could kindly meet the Countess of Aire
in place of the Vicar."</p>

<p>"And I say I shall be charmed," I
repeated; "and I think the prospect is
most alluring, and I shall endeavour to
do the occasion all honour. I shall put
on my best mustard-coloured suit and
my new green Tyrolean hat&mdash;the one
with the feather in it."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should, simply
to meet the Countess of Aire."</p>

<p>"But think of the romance of the
meeting," I urged. "Just fancy! It
is to be at the cross-roads, perhaps
above the nameless grave of a suicide.
There I shall be waiting at five o'clock,
all dressed up in my mustard suit and
tremulous with excitement. And at
last there will dash up to the trysting-place
some splendid equipage, a
silver-plated car, or the family coach
with prancing and foaming horses.
And there, at the cross-roads, we shall
have our little discussion; no speech-making,
all quite informal. Oh, I wish
it could have been moonlight!"</p>

<p>The Vicar's wife began to look quite
scared.</p>

<p>"Are you going mad?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I think so," I said. "Do you know,"
I went on wildly, saying just anything
by way of preserving my sanity, "I
remember that once, when I was quite
little, I half promised I would marry
this highly exalted person; we were
playing together as boy and girl in a
garden."</p>

<p>"But the Countess of Aire," cried the
Vicar's wife, "never was a girl."</p>

<p>"And never was a boy either," I
cried.</p>

<p>"The Countess of Aire," screamed
the Vicar's wife&mdash;yes, she was fairly
screaming by now&mdash;"is a he."</p>

<p>"Now that <i>is</i> absurd," I said.</p>

<p>It was the Vicar, coming round the
corner in his usual hurry, as if every
day were a Sunday, who saved the situation
by bumping into us both.</p>

<p>"The Countess of Aire," shrieked his
poor wife, frantically clutching him by
the coat-tails, "is a man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Vicar. "It is
a terrible age, but thank Heaven for
this," he added piously, "we have yet to
learn of a female County Surveyor."</p>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>.</i> <span class="sc">"That's all right so long as you can carry my
little lot."</span></p></div>

<p><i>Monday, May 17th.</i>&mdash;In theory the
business of a Second Chamber is to
revise calmly and dispassionately the
legislation which has been scamped by
the First. In practice what happens
in our Parliament is that the Peers, after
killing time with academic debates for
two or three months, are suddenly called
upon, whenever a Recess is in contemplation,
to pass three or four Bills
through all their stages in as many days.
At the invitation of Lord <span class="sc">Crawford</span>
(Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> perfunctorily protesting)
they entered upon one of these
legislative spasms this afternoon, and
within less than an hour gave a second
reading to two Bills, and a third reading
to two others, besides listening
politely while Lord <span class="sc">Newton</span> (with him
Lord <span class="sc">Lamington</span>) bewailed the sad fate
of certain German "Templars" (a
species of Teutonic Quaker and quite
harmless, we were told) who, having
been evicted from Palestine, are now
threatened with compulsory deportation
to a Fatherland which they have no
desire to visit. "Some hustlers, your
Peers," remarked a visitor fresh from
Washington.</p>

<p>That distinguished seaman, Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy</span>, would never
think, I am sure, of speaking disrespectfully
of the Equator, but he has no
compunction in abusing the Poles. He
regards their recent advance into the
Ukraine as an unprovoked assault upon
the poor innocent Soviet Government,
and is shocked to think that it should
have even the negative approval of His
Majesty's Ministers. Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law's</span>
assurance that the military stores despatched
to Poland from this country
were the Poles' own property, and that
the fact that they were embarked upon
a vessel called the <i>Jolly George</i> had
no ulterior significance, quite failed to
convince him.</p>

<p>According to Sir <span class="sc">Robert Horne</span> the
price of a best quality worsted suit, as
made by a high-class tailor in this
country, is approximately sixteen to
eighteen guineas, and is still rising,
though he thinks it should not be more
than twenty guineas next winter. His
remark that quite good suits could be
procured at much lower prices prompted
Sir <span class="sc">F. Hall</span> to call attention to the
wares of a fellow-Member, upon which
Mr. <span class="sc">Whitley</span> who was occupying the
Chair, observed, with a touch of Mr.
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> humour, that Question-time
must not be used for advertisement.</p>

<p>The approach of the holidays gave
point to Mr. <span class="sc">Forrest's</span> complaint of
the inefficiency of the present arrangements
for conveying passengers' baggage
by rail. Mr. <span class="sc">Neal</span> expressed a
rather faint hope that the system of
"luggage in advance" might be reintroduced.
There are signs, however,
that the Parliamentary train is already
overloaded and that a good deal of
Ministerial <i>impedimenta</i> will have to
be left behind.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, May 18th.</i>&mdash;Our ancestors,
generous fellows, considered British
citizenship such a fine thing that they
sought to extend its benefits as widely
as possible. Under the existing law
the child of British parents born in
Canton and the child of Chinese parents
born in Stepney are equally entitled to
boast "<i>Civis Britannicus sum</i>." Lord
<span class="sc">Stanhope</span>, regarding this as an objectionable
anomaly, brought forward a
Bill designed to restrict British nationality
to persons of British blood. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414" id="page414"></a>[pg 414]</span>
though he did this with the object of
enabling the Government to fulfil one of
their election pledges, "Britain for the
British," he received scant sympathy
from the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>, who declared
that, far from making for simplicity,
the Bill would produce a state
of things "partly overlapping and
partly contradictory."</p>

<p>Although close upon a hundred
Generals have been demobilised since
the Armistice, there is no immediate
danger of this interesting race disappearing
altogether. Twenty-six of the
finest specimens are specially
maintained at the War Office,
at the comparatively trifling
cost of sixty-two thousand
pounds a year.</p>

<p>Viscount <span class="sc">Curzon</span> has many
times both on sea and land
shown himself the possessor
of a fine nerve, but never more
so than this afternoon, when
he contrasted the activity of
the police in apprehending
infringers of the Motor-Car
Acts with their alleged failure
to capture really dangerous
criminals. Mr. <span class="sc">Shortt</span> gave
the figures of the motor-car
prosecutions, and resisted the
temptation to point out the
extent to which they had been
swollen by the noble Lord's
own delinquencies.</p>

<p>A listless House resumed
the discussion of the Government
of Ireland Bill. Mr.
<span class="sc">Fisher</span> declined to accept a
proposal to include nine
counties, instead of six, in
the Northern Parliament, the
view of the Government being
that they must cut their legislative
Ulster according to their
Protestant cloth. Mr. <span class="sc">Clynes</span>
announced the intention of
the Labour Party to wash their
hands of the Bill, which he
regarded as a sheer waste of
time. Undeterred by the prospect of
this calamity the House passed Clause I.
by a majority of 152.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 19th.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Bottomley</span>
obtained leave to introduce a
Bill to create a Public Defender, in
spite of an attempt by Lieut.-Commander
<span class="sc">Kenworthy</span> to strangle the
bantling at its birth. He did not succeed
in making clear his objection to
the measure, and it is thought that he
may have confused it with Sir <span class="sc">Robert
Horne's</span> Bill to regulate the Supply of
Gas.</p>

<p>When the Committee-stage of the
Home Rule Bill was resumed the subject
of debate was the Irish Council,
the pivot on which all hopes of unity
are centred. Exactly fifty Members
were present to listen to this epoch-marking
discussion, carried on entirely
by a few English enthusiasts and the
Members from Ulster. They differed
profoundly on most of the details of
the Council's constitution, but were
unanimous in expressing the belief that
nothing much mattered since it would
never work. Lord <span class="sc">Winterton</span> indeed
prophesied that if it is composed, as
seems probable, of a solid <i>bloc</i> of Sinn
Feiners from the South and another of
Unionists from the North there would
be a free fight at every meeting. In
that case it may become a popular
body after all.</p>

<h3>UNIVERSAL "TRAINING."</h3>

<p>The Great Eastern have inaugurated
a new plan for helping food-producers.
They are sending out an instructional
train, manned by experts and full of
live stock&mdash;poultry and rabbits and
goats&mdash;which is to traverse their system
for two months. The contents will be
on view and lectures will be given to
cottagers, artisans, clerks&mdash;to all in fact
who are interested in the breeding of
the lesser live-stock, apple-growing, etc.
The plan is so excellent that we feel
sure it is bound to lead to
further developments in regard
to the industries and
pursuits that really matter.</p>

<p>The rural districts, it may
be safely assumed, already
know something about agriculture.
But many areas are
still in a state of benighted
ignorance about the results of
intensive culture applied to
the arts. There are parts of
the Cornish Riviera, for example,
in which you may
travel for miles and miles
without hearing a syncopated
orchestra. Here is the opportunity
of the Great Western&mdash;to
equip and despatch a
train band or band train, with
a <i>personnel</i> carefully selected
from the best negro performers
(of whom there are now
several thousands in London),
with the view of brightening
and enlightening the existence
of those unfortunate
villagers hitherto beyond the
range of the beneficent dominion
of din. As an antidote
to agricultural discontent we
can conceive nothing more
salutary.</p>

<p>Again, there are portions of
the Black Country where the
very names of the leading
Georgian poets are unknown.
A troupe of poets, personally conducted
by Mr. <span class="sc">Edward March</span> or Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund
Gosse</span>, or both, should without delay
be organized and sent forth by the
North-Western and Midland Railways
to give recitations over every portion
of both systems. The effect on the output
would be instantaneous. London
should not be allowed to monopolize
this stimulant to activity. Minstrelsy
should be mobilized. It is true that a
small group are interested in rotary
motion, but we want to see all the
Georgian poets on "Wheels." If we
cannot have a free breakfast-table, at
least we ought to be in a position to indulge
without any control the appetite
of our people for free verse.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span>

<p>Lastly, the plan of the instructional
train might be applied with the most
beneficial results to spreading the taste
for the Russian Ballet. We do not
hope to detach such bright particular
stars as <span class="sc">Pavlova</span> or <span class="sc">Karsavina</span> from
the London stage, but at the present
moment, according to the latest statistical
returns, there are several hundred
Russian <i>premi&egrave;res danseuses</i> and thousands
of <i>coryph&eacute;es</i> of all grades congregated
in the Metropolis, many of them
without engagements, and reduced to
giving dancing lessons to the daughters
of profiteers, Crypto-Semites and other
unpropitious persons. The organisation
of a Russian Ballet train would therefore
serve the double purpose of freeing
these gifted performers from an ignoble
use of their talents and at the same
time initiating the provinces in the
poetry of motion.</p>

<h3>THE PERFECT SCULLERY.</h3>

<p>I was more than interested in the
article "About Bathrooms" which appeared
in the columns of <i>Punch</i> of
March 31st last, because I too always
smoke a pipe in a hot bath, to which I
add the habit of reading, not books&mdash;they
are too sacred to risk&mdash;but newspapers.
I also frequently indulge in
a further luxury at this time, a cup of
coffee, which rests on the sponge and
soap bridge between sips. Of course
the soap sometimes falls into the coffee,
and if this is undetected in time a
slight frothing at the mouth occurs, but
no really serious harm ensues.</p>

<p>I tried the effect of pictures round
the bath&mdash;pictures with a shiver in
them that made me pull the water up
closer round my neck. But I found
that they were being ruined by the
steam, so I removed them and am now
looking for some undraped but respectable
statuettes that will give the same
result.</p>

<p>I have not tried the rich rug stunt.
The only rug we possess which might
be so described is a Persian one, and is
on our cat at present. When she has
done with it I intend to spread it over
the only part of the bathroom floor
which is permanently dry. And, suffering
as our bathroom does from that
lack of space which the writer on bathrooms
so justly laments, the "profound
chair" is out of the question.</p>

<p>While his views on bathrooms are
sound it seems evident to me that the
writer of the <i>Punch</i> article lives in pre-war
style&mdash;with servants. We don't.
Our last maid left us to be a Waac and
has not been seen since in the precincts
of domestic servitude. I did hear something
about her approaching marriage
to a Colonel of Hussars, but don't know
whether it came off or not.</p>

<p>It seems to me that what is chiefly
wrong with houses, at any rate with
our house, is the scullery. It is smaller
than most bathrooms, and, though it
is anything but bare, the furnishings
of it are not intriguing to one who,
like myself, spends therein such an
undue proportion of the twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Our present char comes three days
a week, about eleven o'clock, has a look
round with a duster in one hand till
thirteen o'clock, then lunches and (probably)
has a cigarette. She leaves at
fifteen o'clock. This means that I help
with the washing-up of the breakfast,
tea and dinner things on char days,
and of luncheon things as well on non-char
days. My share of the task is
generally the wiping. This is not such
an engrossing occupation as to prevent
one from thinking great thoughts at
the same time, thoughts worthy to be
committed to paper afterwards. Now,
as a song-writer, I ask how can one get
inspiration while gazing at a row of
saucepans, a cullender, a bottle of metal
paste, one ditto knife polish and a plate-rack?</p>

<p>If any room in the house should be
luxuriously furnished it is the scullery.
But what is even more important, I
think, is that the whole game of scullerying
should be revolutionised. The implements
still in use are worthy of the
Stone Age. The rules should be so
framed that there should be little or no
washing-up, in the ordinary acceptation
of the term.</p>

<p>Let me put before you a pen-picture
of the scullery of my dreams. A cosy
pleasant room, the whole length of the
house in fact, with a south aspect, full
advantage of which is secured by a long
window filled with leaded lights of
opalescent glass (in order that the
Hilary-Tompkins next door, who have
two servants, may not grow too ribald).
On the western wall is a rich mosaic depicting
Hercules cleansing the Augean
stable, and below this a fountain of
clear limpid water, warmed to at least
twenty over grease-proof, gushes forth
and flows in a pellucid stream, between
banks of marble, to the eastern end of
the chamber. At the fountain head
reclines Euphemia, my wife, arrayed
and fructed proper, who leisurely drops
the crockery into the stream. At the
other end of the room, seated in a
"profound chair" by the estuary, where
the waters of the River Plate fall into
the Sink Basin, behold me lazily watching
the cups and platters as they glide
gently down the rippling flood towards
me, dexterously fishing out each fresh
arrival and depositing it in a hot-air
receptacle conveniently placed for its
accommodation.</p>

<p>Such, I say, is the scullery of my
dreams, in which the washing up of a
nine-hole-course dinner would be as
pleasant as a round of golf. No unsightly
pots, pans, brooms, tins or
other junk pollute the apartment; they
are in the dream ante-chamber, to be
hereinafter described or not, if the
Editor sees fit. [<span class="sc">Ed.</span>&mdash;He does not see
fit.]</p>

<h3>THE GREAT DIVORCE QUESTION.</h3>

<p>When I week-end with people I like
them to be tactful. I thought Mrs.
Benham lacked the tact essential to a
hostess when she said, "We breakfast
at half-past nine on Sundays. That
will give us all ample time to get to
church." She never seemed to contemplate
the possibility of my having a
Sunday morning indisposition.</p>

<p>Now there is no virtue in compulsory
church-going, but as I was for it I
accepted my fate cheerfully. I walked
with Benham across the park to the
church. He is the adopted Candidate
for the division, and he took the opportunity
of rehearsing to me a speech he
was preparing which showed up Bolshevism
in its true colours. Though no
Sabbatarian I have the deepest objection
to political speeches on a Sunday,
and it was really a relief when I reached
the gracious refuge of the church.</p>

<p>The family pew was a little too near
the pulpit, but it was most comfortable.
When the sermon came on I settled
myself in a restful corner to listen to
the Archdeacon. After a moment or
two I felt he was on sound orthodox
lines and needed no supervision of
mine. I leant back and gradually dozed
off.</p>

<p>Then in my sleep I became aware of
a stern voice disapproving of something.
It seemed to me that Benham was at a
public meeting denouncing Bolshevism
to a very lethargic audience. It was
my bounden duty to support my host.
"Hear, hear! Hear, hear!" I said
most emphatically.</p>

<p>I woke up just as the last "Hear"
left my lips. The choir-boys were
sniggering&mdash;you can always trust them
to do that. A large curate was eyeing
me as if I were something between a
leper and a dissenter. Mrs. Benham
was looking indignantly down the pew
at me; Benham was tactfully but ineffectively
pretending not to have heard
anything.</p>

<p>I went hot all over. What could I
do? Should I be prosecuted for brawling
in church? Could I possibly explain
to the Archdeacon that I spoke in my
sleep, and therefore was not responsible?
There are some explanations that aggravate
an offence.</p>

<p>There came a terrible moment when
the service was over. The Archdeacon
stepped deliberately towards our pew.
I was tempted to bolt through a stained-glass
window. And then, as he came
near, he beamed on me.</p>

<p>"Don't apologise, my dear Sir, don't
apologise. If you were so moved by
the picture I drew of the inroads the
new Divorce Law would make on the
sanctity of our homes why should you
not express your indignation? Enthusiasm
is far better than lethargy."</p>

<p>"Mr. Johnson feels very strongly on
the subject," said Mrs. Benham. I had
never said a word about it before her in
my life.</p>

<p>That night she surveyed me carefully.
"I can see you've a headache, Mr.
Johnson," she said. "You had better
not go to church; there is nothing
worse than a hot church for headache."</p>

<p>After all, Mrs. Benham is not without
tact.</p>

<h3>MAGNANIMOUS MOTTOES.</h3>

<p>A writer in <i>The Evening Standard</i>
calls attention to the latest ornamentation
of the fine old Elizabethan Hall of
Gray's Inn, in the shape of the arms of
Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span>, who as a past Treasurer
of the Inn is entitled to this
armorial distinction in his lifetime.
But, he goes on, "it was not so much
the arms as their motto which attracted
me&mdash;the motto of a man who began his
brilliant career as plain Mr. <span class="sc">F. E. Smith</span>.
Now the Latin for 'smith,' as an artisan,
is <i>faber</i> (artificer or fabricator
in the primal sense); so, with a fine
democratic courage, Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span>
has chosen as his family motto: '<i>Faber
me&aelig; Fortun&aelig;</i>' (Architect of my own
Fortune)."</p>

<p>We agree; but it must not be supposed
that Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span> has an
entire monopoly of this frank spirit.
Other eminent men who have recently
been ennobled or decorated have shown
a similar frankness. Thus it may not
be known that Lord <span class="sc">Riddell</span> has
adopted a motto which reveals the
comparatively modest beginnings of
his greatness. Lord <span class="sc">Riddell</span> was, and
we believe still is, the proprietor of <i>The
News of the World</i>. Now the Latin
for news or newness is <i>novitas</i> (novelty
or unfamiliarity in the primal sense);
so with a noble democratic courage he
has chosen as his family motto: "<i>S&aelig;culorum
vetustati pr&aelig;stat novitas mundi</i>"
(The news of the world surpasses the
antiquity of the ages). It is rather a
long motto, but it is eminently Ciceronian
in its cadence.</p>

<p>Then there is the case of Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span>,
who began his brilliant career
as simple Mr. <span class="sc">Harmsworth</span>. Now the
Latin for "harm" is <i>damnum</i> (loss or
sacrifice in the primal sense), and for
"worth" <i>dignus</i>. So, with a fine loyalty
to his antecedents, Lord <span class="sc">Northcliffe</span>
has adopted the heroic and pleasantly
alliterative motto: "<i>Per damna ad
dignitatem</i>" (Through sacrifices to
worthiness).</p>

<p>Even more ingenious is the motto
chosen by Lord <span class="sc">Beaverbrook</span>, who
began his coruscating career as a native
of New Brunswick. Now the Latin for
"beaver" is <i>castor</i> (not to be confounded
with the small wheels attached to the
legs of arm-chairs), and in Greek mythology
Castor was the brother of Pollux,
who was famed as a boxer. "Boxer"
is a synonym for "prize-fighter";
"prize-fighter" recalls "<span class="sc">Wells</span>";
"wells" contain "water," and "water"
suggests "brook." So Lord <span class="sc">Beaverbrook</span>,
with a true allegiance to Canada,
coupled with a scholarly mastery of the
niceties of Classical etymology, has
chosen for his family motto: "<i>E Castore
Pollux</i>" (Brook from the Beaver).</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p>There has recently been a notable output of books of
"personalities" and critical appreciations, contemporary,
historical and (for the most part) iconoclastic. One may
therefore say that Mr. <span class="sc">Horace G. Hutchinson</span> is distinctly
of the movement in compiling his <i>Portraits of the 'Eighties</i>
(<span class="sc">Unwin</span>). This is certainly a volume that anyone can dip
into with instruction and entertainment, even if (to be quite
honest) the former is likely to predominate. The fact
is that one has become so used to the satirical method in
portraiture, in which the attack is all and the subject
emerges only as a beriddled target, that an ordinary pen-picture,
however faithful, is apt to seem heavy by contrast.
Mr. <span class="sc">Hutchinson</span> certainly is not of the slingers; he will just
"tell you about" the notable persons of his period, setting
down nothing in malice, omitting little however banal, and
rejecting no aphorism or anecdote as outworn. Perhaps his
nearest approach to the popular method is a very occasional
touch of gentle irony, as when he permits himself to say of
<span class="sc">G. W. E. Russell</span> (to whose <i>Portraits of the Seventies</i> the
present volume is intended as a sequel) that he "used to
drive about London in a carriage picked out in colours that
did not suggest that he sought seclusion." I have no
space for the barest list of the sitters in Mr. <span class="sc">Hutchinson's</span>
crowded picture of a time rich in character, his treatment
of which aims rather at covering a wide ground than at
intimacy of detail. To mention but one, it is interesting
to compare his General <span class="sc">Gordon</span> with the recent presentment
of him by another hand. If the result is more
creditable to Mr. <span class="sc">Hutchinson's</span> kindliness than to his wit,
it may serve as an apt comment on the whole book.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Beauty and Bands</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>) is not, as you might
excusably suppose, a treatise on syncopation or the decline
of Jazz, but takes its title from a verse in the Book of
Proverbs. Really what the story most illustrates is the
extent to which a clever and experienced writer can clothe
a wildly impossible plot with some aspect of reality. Miss
<span class="sc">Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler</span> assuredly does not lack
courage; having thought out a "good situation" (which it
certainly is) she was not going to be put off by any considerations
of probability. I can't resist some sketch of it,
even at the risk of spoiling your pleasure. Suppose a lovely
but selfish wife, bored to the point of flight from a well-intentioned
husband, then involved in a railway smash
which disfigures her beauty, destroys her memory and incidentally
reforms her character; let her by plausible circumstance
be mistaken for another traveller in the wrecked
train and under a new name and personality meet her
husband, fall in love with him, but be compelled to reject
his suit by the presumption that his vanished wife may
still be living&mdash;as I hinted, the result in situations is enough
to satisfy the most exacting, the only real drawback being
that not all Miss <span class="sc">Fowler's</span> pleasantly persuasive efforts can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>
make me believe a word of it. If she had dared a little
more, and inflicted the husband with blindness, impaired
hearing and slight mental decay, I would have stretched
a point and supposed that, during a protracted courtship,
he might never have recognised his own wife. Lacking
these concessions I can only report an entertaining but
preposterous absurdity.</p>

<hr />

<p>Those of us who read <i>With the Persian Expedition</i> know
something about the Hush-Hush Army; enough, at any
rate, to whet our appetites for more. Let me then recommend
<i>The Adventures of Dunsterforce</i> (<span class="sc">Arnold</span>) to your
notice, and assure you that it is a most lively account of
as strange an enterprise as any that the War brought
forth. Briefly, the object of General <span class="sc">Dunsterville's</span>
mission was to prevent German and Turkish penetration
in the area of the Caucasus, Baku and the Caspian Sea. In
January, 1918, he set
out from Baghdad with
what he calls "the leading
party." Continually
hampered by lack of
men, the mission failed
to achieve its original
object; but what it accomplished
in most
difficult circumstances
was of great value to
the Allies. The conditions
at the time when
the author sailed from
Enzeli with his "Dunsterforce"
to raise the
siege of Baku were delightfully
cosmopolitan.
He describes himself as
"a British General on
the Caspian, the only
sea unploughed before
by British keels, on
board a ship named
after a South African
Dutch President and
whilom enemy, sailing
from a Persian port under
the Serbian flag to
relieve from the Turks
a body of Armenians
in a revolutionary Russian town." "Let the reader," he
adds, "pick his way through that delirious tangle, and
envy us our task who may." After pursuing the tricky
course of this astounding adventure I confess myself lost,
not in its mazes, thanks to an excellent map, but in profound
admiration for "Dunsterforce" and its leader.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>A Merchant Fleet at War</i> (<span class="sc">Cassell</span>) it takes nearly a
hundred pictures to illustrate the fighting effort and experiences
of the Cunard Steamship Company. Quite a lot
of them are from snap-shot photographs actually taken
while in action with submarines, and where through an
unfortunate oversight these have not been available someone
with vivid brush and imagination has done wonders to
fill the gap. Certainly such a subject as the passing of the
<i>Lusitania</i>, her decks still packed though her great bulk is
three-quarters gone, the sea crowded with boats and, presumably,
drowning Englishmen, is perhaps a little poignant
to be handled in this fashion; but no one can object to
seeing a U-boat nose-diving at the instance of S.S. <i>Phrygia</i>,
or another being messed up by a shell from the <i>Valeria</i>;
while the historic fight between <i>Carmania</i>, in Prussian
blue, and <i>Cap Trafalgar</i>, mostly crimson, competes for
lurid splendour with the <i>Mauretania</i> in "dazzle" costume,
staged with a sky to match. Incidentally Mr. <span class="sc">Archibald
Hurd</span> has acted as showman for the collection. One might
have found his exposition rather more substantial but for
Sir <span class="sc">Julian Corbett's</span> first volume of <i>Naval Operations</i>,
which has set an uncomfortably high standard in sea
history. Frankly, the deeds of the men of our merchant
fleets, of the Cunarders no less than others, were so magnificent
that a book to be worthy of them must be in itself as
modest and unpretentious as they were. This book is not.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Tall Villa</i> (<span class="sc">Collins</span>), by "<span class="sc">Lucas Malet</span>," has a
strange theme&mdash;no less than the deliberate wooing, by a
sensitive unhappy woman, of a more unhappy ghost. <i>Lord
Oxley</i> had lived in this odd villa on Primrose Hill a hundred
years ago with a noted
stage beauty who had
finally jilted him. One
of his descendants,
<i>Frances Copley</i>, banished
from Grosvenor
Square by her husband's
financial failure
and conscious of the
growing rift between
them, detaches herself
more and more from
the world of sense till
she is&mdash;well, till she is
in just the right mood
for seeing ghosts. First
it is a mere shadow that
stands by her piano;
next a faceless figure,
exquisitely dressed, sits
brooding in her chair;
then she hears a pistol
shot; later&mdash;but this
will spoil your entertainment.
I cannot say
I was quite convinced,
but I certainly was held
to the end by a tale very
skilfully, almost too
carefully, told, and by
the cleverness of the
four portraits&mdash;<i>Frances</i> herself, the adorable <i>Lady Lucia</i> her
cousin, <i>Charlie Montagu</i> the passionate bounder, and, a little
less definite, <i>Morris Copley</i> the stockbroking husband.</p>

<hr />

<p>Messrs. <span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span> have beaten up various
American magazines and shepherded a few <i>Waifs and Strays</i>
of short stories by the late "<span class="sc">O. Henry</span>" (<span class="sc">William Sydney
Porter</span>) into a final volume of their excellent edition of
his works. They have also included appreciations by
various American and British critics of the author's
achievement, together with some sparse biographical details.
The stories are of varying value, exercises on a sentimental
motive cloaked by humorous or bizarre exaggeration of
language, with those unexpected but ingeniously plausible
endings which are of the essence of "<span class="sc">O. Henry's</span>" method.
Of the criticisms, English readers will be most affected
by Mr. <span class="sc">Stephen Leacock's</span> "The Amazing Genius of
<span class="sc">O. Henry</span>," an analytical appreciation in the most handsome
terms, deploring English neglect of this master of
one of the most difficult of art-forms&mdash;a neglect which we
have done something of late to remedy.</p>
